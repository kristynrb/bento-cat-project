# bento-cat-project

### Installation
  - Download files locally
  - Run `npm start`
  - Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your browser to load the app

#### Libraries used:
- [Angularjs]()
- [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) for style framework
- [AngularJStoArray Filter](https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter) to help with sorting
- [xml2js](https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js) to help with converting XML to JSON
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for heart icon

Next steps:
- Refine the sorting. The sort will pull the last word which may include a special character. Those special characters (like parenthesis) are valued lower than numbers and are displayed first.
- Have a functioning "next" and "previous" buttons for individual view.
